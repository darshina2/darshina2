## 👋 Hi, I am Darshana

I’m an AI and NLP engineer with hands-on experience building LLM-powered systems, data pipelines, and production-ready web applications. My work spans GenAI, RAG, multi-agent systems, and applied ML, with a strong focus on translating business needs into scalable AI solutions.

Currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Digital Engineering and working on AI-driven technology scouting systems as part of my master’s thesis.

🧠 What I Do Best

🔹Build LLM-based applications (RAG, multi-agent pipelines, prompt engineering)

🔹Design data pipelines for large-scale analysis and reliability

🔹Apply ML models for text analytics, classification, and insights

🔹Develop full-stack AI tools with clean, production-ready architectures

🔥 Featured Projects

🔹 Multi-Agent AI for Technology Scouting
LLM-powered system automating trend analysis and innovation discovery using multi-agent workflows.
➡️ LLMs, LangChain, RAG, Agents

🔹 GenAI-Based Thematic Analysis Tool
Interactive application for real-time insight extraction and decision support.
➡️ Python, LLMs, Embeddings, streamlit, plotly

🔹 Fact-Checking Pipeline for LLMs
Automated pipeline to collect, validate, and analyze factual claims for trustworthy AI.
➡️ ML, Data Pipelines, Evaluation

🛠 Tech Stack

Python | LLMs | RAG | LangChain | Vector DBs | FastAPI | React | Docker

🏢 Experience

Previously worked with Fraunhofer IFF, IWH Halle, BSH, and Siemens on AI, data, and engineering-driven projects.
